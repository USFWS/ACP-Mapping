ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR ACP_2007_2019_20210310.ZIP


OBSERVATION FILES (Data/ACP_QCObs_YYYY_Name.csv)

- 2010 resulted in 3 different observers, 2018 had 1 observer, and all other years had 2 observers.  
- Latitude and longitude fields are of unknown accuracy and might be 500m from the reported locations due to:
 (1) GPS satellite accuracy,
 (2) distance from observed bird to center strip of transect (observer) could be up to 200m,
 (3) position of bird with respect to the plane when the location is marked (in front of or behind). 
 - There is no written protocol for this survey, but methods can be gleaned from any existing annual reports.
- There will be unknown deviations from a consistent observation process within and across observers due to individual observer tendencies. 
    For example, some observers may have given different level of effort to different species, especially snow geese, owls, and raptors, among others.  
    Differences in densities across observers or year-observer combinations should be interpreted with caution.
- See enclosed metadata file "YKD Coastal Zone Survey QC Transcribed Data_20210309.html" for pertinent field definitions (a data dictionary). 
    This file was written for the Yukon Delta Coastal Zone survey but it applies to the Arctic Coastal Plain survey as well. To find the description of the QCObs file, expand the 'data dictionary' section.
    Then expand the 'Domain' and 'Entity' section. From there you can expand other sections to read full descriptions.  

DESIGN TRANSECTS (Design_Files/Design_Transects/ACP_YYYY_Transects.shp)

- Design transect locations and lengths should be treated as a general guide to survey design and not an accurate measure of survey effort or plane location in any given year.
- See enclosed file "YKD Coastal Zone Survey Design Transects _20210309.html" for pertinent field definitions. 

DESIGN STRATA (Design_Files/Design_Strata/ACP_YYYYtoYYYY_DesignStrata.shp)

- This is a polygon .shp layer where the STRAT and STRATNAME fields correspond with sampling intensity (variation in transect spacing).  
- AREA and LENGTH fields should be checked or recalculated since they are of unknown origin and precision.
